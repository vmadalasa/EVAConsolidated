To run the model, we need to upload all the necessary packagesto the colab directory. The packages can be found in the S7 folder of EVA4 repo.


### **Objective**

Achieve the following on the **CIFAR-10** dataset:

- Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository and add it to your API/repo
- Use data loader, train, test, and utils code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10.
- Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed).
- achieve **85%** accuracy, as many epochs as required.

### **Model Statistics:**

- ResNet18 - BasicBlock - [2,2,2,2]
- Batch Size: 128
- Number of Parameters: 11,173,962
- Epochs: 50

### **Results**

Achieved accuracy of

**Test - 91.58%**
**Train - 96.66%**
